3. **Technology Stack**: Primary languages, frameworks, and tools used
4. **Testing Strategy**: How to run tests and write new ones
5. **Key Patterns**: Important coding patterns and conventions specific to this project

## Initial Setup Guidance

When initializing this project, consider:
- Creating a clear project structure based on the chosen technology stack
- Setting up appropriate configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Establishing coding standards and linting rules
- Implementing a basic test framework

## Note

This CLAUDE.md should be updated as soon as the project structure is established to provide accurate guidance for future development work.
